We’re moving quickly, looking across our businesses and brands and taking bold steps to better serve customers’ evolving needs. That’s why now is an exciting time to join our team. You’ll have opportunities to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good.\\nYou’ll do all this in an environment of excellence and the highest ethical standards – a place where values such as integrity, inclusive diversity and accountability are paramount. We empower every employee to lead, drive change and give back where they work and live. Our people are our greatest strength, and we work as one team in service of our customers and communities. Plus, Allstate is changing how, when, and where we work-to lead us boldly into our future. We're empowering our employees to create better ways of working through more intentional use of communication and collaboration practices, processes and tools.\\nEverything we do at Allstate is driven by a shared purpose: to protect people from life’s uncertainties so they can realize their hopes and dreams. For more than 89 years we’ve thrived by staying a step ahead of whatever’s coming next – to give customers peace of mind no matter what changes they face. We acted with conviction to advocate for seat belts, air bags and graduated driving laws. We help give survivors of domestic violence a voice through financial empowerment. We’ve been an industry leader in pricing sophistication, telematics, digital photo claims and, more recently, device and identity protection. We are the Good Hands. We don’t follow the trends. We set them. Job Family Summary:\\n\\nData, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 360+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers. We are partnering to incorporate analytics into every aspect of the enterprise. We are avid about learning new ways to get the most value from our massive data resources and leading-edge technology. We are committed to building an inclusive and diverse team where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from different backgrounds so that we can better serve our diverse customer needs.\\n\\n\\nTraditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:\\n\\n1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.\\n2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.\\n3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.\\n\\nAs a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.\\n\\nYou will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.\\n\\n\\nThis job does have supervisory duties. Education and Experience:\\n\\nEducation and Experience\\nCompensation Data\\nThe compensation range for this position is $119,700 and $161,000 per year, based on experience and qualifications.\\nThe candidate(s) offered this position will be required to submit to a background investigation, which includes a drug screen.\\n\\nGood Work.
