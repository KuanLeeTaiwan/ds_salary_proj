Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties.

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties.

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.

Traditionally, filing an insurance claim consists of a lengthy initial call, followed by a complex experience of several phone calls, emails and paperwork to indemnify the involved parties. This is a time-consuming process and not the type of experience customers have come to expect in 2022. For this reason, Allstate has launched a 3-pronged digital initiative to transform the way that claims are handled:

1. Redesign and simplify the claims process to be customer centric.
2. Provide technology solutions for asynchronous claims handling, allowing customers to interact with Allstate in the manner they prefer, at the time they prefer.
3. Identify and build data science solutions for usage in this new digital process to expedite the handling of the claim and reduce customer effort in completing the process more rapidly.

As a D3 Claims Digital Transformation Manager, you'll be responsible for the data science arm of this transformation. To support this transformation, you'll partner with Allstate teams in solving business problems using data science. You'll work closely with technology and claims to build and execute on a data science roadmap. Claims, technology and data science will work together as one team to accomplish a common goal.

You will lead a diverse team of data scientists, data engineers and business consultants to drive rapid change. In addition to traditional machine learning, your team will also have responsibility for building computer vision and natural language processing models. In the spirit of agile, you will lead the team to quickly develop analytic prototypes, test the prototypes in market, develop the prototypes into full products, deploy the products for widespread usage, and continue iterating on these products.
